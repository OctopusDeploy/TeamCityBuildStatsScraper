             * A Summary gives us a sliding-time-window view of our wait times. The library we use holds a small buffer and calculates a
             * sliding P50 / P90 / P99 value for all the observations. We're unlikely to need the 'sum' value, but it could be used in our
             * monitoring visualisations along with 'count' to work out a mean (as opposed to P50 which is median). However, as we observe
             * every ten seconds a value that is only growing, the sum values are a bit misleading. It could be the same build continuing to wait
             * ever-increasing amounts, which means that the _sum will increase exponentially as the build continues to wait.
             *
             * The P-values should be relatively meaningful, though. Given the 'spikiness' of our build queue waits, we should be able to alert on a
             * P-value from this and not get too many false positives. A brand new build that waits for 5 seconds won't outweigh another build of the
             * same type that's been waiting for 5 minutes, for example. In reverse, if 50 builds of the same type all wait for 5 seconds only, then
             * repeated observation of a build that is now waiting a long time will shift the P90 and P99 values relatively quickly. If we find that
             * this dynamic is happening too fast, the first thing to try should be to *increase* the scrape interval above in StartAsync() so that
             * frequent scraping of long-waiting builds doesn't skew the data higher as quickly.
             * 
             * The output on the server looks a bit like this:
             *
             * queued_build_wait_times_by_type{buildType="OctopusDeploy_OctopusServer_Build_BuildPortal",quantile="0.5"} 2874.183
